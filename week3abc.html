<h2>LAB: Version Control with Github</h2>
All of the materials for this class live in two places: this website, and <a href="https://github.com/caseyanderson/phys_cpu_projects" target="_blank">this</a> GitHub repository. Following the completion of this lab, it will be your responsibility to keep up to date with the classroom materials as they are added.
<br/>Start by signing up for a GitHub account (it's free) <a href="https://github.com/join" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br/>Next, go <a href="https://git-scm.herokuapp.com/downloads" target="_blank">here</a> to download and install the latest version of Git.
<br/>At the terminal, tell git your username by entering <span class="lang:sh decode:true  crayon-inline " >git config --global user.name "USERNAME"</span>.
<br/>Then tell git your email address (the one associated with your GitHub account) by entering <span class="lang:sh decode:true  crayon-inline " >git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"</span>.
<br/>To confirm that you have configured git correctly, check the .gitconfig file by running the following line at the terminal: <span class="lang:sh decode:true  crayon-inline " >sudo nano .gitconfig</span>.
<br/>In the next sequence, we are going to move inside of the NEWDIRECTORY folder we made in the first lab and clone the class repository:
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true " >
cd NEWDIRECTORY
git clone https://github.com/caseyanderson/phys_cpu_projects.git
#git clone copies the repository into a new directory in this folder
cd phys_cpu_projects
git log # shows the history of this repository
# type q to exit log
git pull # check for updates from source
# if there are updates, download them</pre>
<br/>At least once a week you should <span class="lang:sh decode:true  crayon-inline " >git pull</span> inside this directory to stay up to date.
