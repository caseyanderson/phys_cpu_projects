### Course Description
This project-oriented class leads students through several open-ended, small-to-mid-scale projects. Students will explore interaction, environmental/ambient sensing strategies, and more complex digital electronics systems as a means to increase their understanding of contemporary approaches to electronics and computation. Regular critiques will provide an opportunity for students to share their individual research with their colleagues as well as receive direct feedback from the instructor.

### Class Goals
Upon successful completion of this course, students will gain facility in the following topics:
* Electronics
* Programming (Arduino, Python)
* Hybrid Digital/Analog Systems (with a focus on Arduino)
* How to effectively, and creatively author with Technology in an Art and Design context

### Requirements
* Apple Laptop
* [Arduino Budget Pack](https://www.adafruit.com/products/193) or [Arduino Starter Pack](https://www.adafruit.com/products/68)
