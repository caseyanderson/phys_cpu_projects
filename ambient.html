<h2>brief</h2>
<br/>For this project you will select an input (sound, light, etc) from some outdoor location and use it to drive some output (sound, light, motion). The specific input, and output, selection is up to you, but a change in the input must result in a change in the output. Similarly, this input/output relationship should somehow change throughout the day.
<br/><strong>Project 1 Requirements:</strong>
<ul><li>an arduino</li>
<li>one input (a sensor of some sort)</li>
<li>one output (a light, sound, or motion)</li>
<li>the relationship between the input and ouput should change slowly over a long period of time</li></ul>
<br/>Your input should be environmentally determined (light via tree branches, wind, temperature, etc.), but you should be able to demo a version of it in class.
<br/>Your project should be seen as a subtle addition to some outdoor location. Perhaps just barely noticeable. How would your project function outdoors over the long term? Write a story, or create a context, that situates a scenario in which your project should be left outside for a long period of time.</li></ul>
