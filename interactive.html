<h2>brief</h2>
<br/>In this project you will create a scenario for a person (or multiple people) to explore. While the specifics are up to you, the user or audience must have the ability to make at least one significant choice to shape the overall experience. Part of the success of your project will depend on creating a vivid context that an audience member/user will want to be engaged in for a period of time.
<br/>Key question: why is this interesting to someone other than me and how can I make this experience as memorable as possible for the audience/user?
