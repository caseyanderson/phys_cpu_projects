<h2>Project Proposals</h2>
<br/>You will be required to write a project proposal for each of the three projects you complete in this class. You can think of this as a tool to help organize your thoughts as you work through your ideas week-by-week. Project proposals will be treated as homework which you will be asked to edit and resubmit following weekly critiques. Upon completion of a project you must also deliver every version of your proposal (labeled by date).
<br/><br/>The proposal process will function as follows:
<ol><li><strong>project 1, week 1:</strong> the project brief is delivered (accompanied by an introduction and a series of demos for context), version 1 of your proposal is due the subsequent week. Proposals should always be accompanied by a demonstration that proves that you are working towards the completion of your project.</li>
<li><strong>project 1, week 2:</strong> your proposal is due, via email, Sunday morning by 9am (prior to class). You will receive feedback on your proposal and be directed to rewrite said to reflect suggested changes and your own progress on the project. The second proposal, as well as whatever it takes to advance your project to the next step (and prove via demo), will be due the subsequent week.</li>
<li><strong>project 1, week 3:</strong> your reworked proposal is due, via email, Sunday morning by 9am (prior to class). You will present a preliminary demonstration of the status of your project to the class, receiving final feedback to both rework your proposal and to wrap your project up. This is also the last week to work on your project in class and receive feedback.</li>
<li><strong>project 1, final / project 2, week 1:</strong> You will present a final demonstration of your (working) project to the class as well as submit each version of your proposal and appropriate media documentation for a final project grade. The second half of class this week will function to introduce the subsequent project (at which point this process restarts).</li>
</ol>
